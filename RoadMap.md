## üß± Stage 2: PySpark Basics

**Goal:** Learn how to work with Spark using Python (PySpark).

### Topics:

* Setting up PySpark (local + Google Colab + Databricks)
* SparkSession and SparkContext
* RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
  * Creation, Transformations (map, filter), Actions (collect, reduce)
* DataFrames:
  * Creation from CSV, JSON, Parquet
  * Select, filter, where, withColumn, drop, distinct
  * Data types and schema inference

### Practice:

* Load sample datasets and apply basic DataFrame transformations

### Tools:

* Jupyter Notebooks or Databricks Community Edition

## üìä Stage 3: PySpark SQL

**Goal:** Use SQL in Spark for structured data operations.

### Topics:

* SQLContext & SparkSession
* Running SQL queries on DataFrames
* Temporary Views and Global Views
* SQL Functions (`groupBy`, `agg`, `orderBy`, `join`, `union`, etc.)
* Window functions

### Practice:

* Solve basic SQL problems using PySpark SQL

---

## üìà Stage 4: Data Preprocessing & Advanced Transformations

**Goal:** Learn real-world preprocessing techniques for data pipelines.

### Topics:

* Handling missing values
* String manipulations
* Joins, aggregations, and groupings
* Working with timestamps and dates
* User Defined Functions (UDFs)

### Practice:

* Build a pipeline to clean and transform a dirty dataset

---

## üß† Stage 5: PySpark MLlib (Machine Learning)

**Goal:** Use Spark for distributed ML tasks.

### Topics:

* MLlib basics (pipeline-based API)
* Feature Engineering
  * `StringIndexer`, `VectorAssembler`, `StandardScaler`
* Supervised Learning
  * Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
* Unsupervised Learning
  * KMeans, PCA
* Model Evaluation: `BinaryClassificationEvaluator`, `MulticlassClassificationEvaluator`
* Model persistence (save/load model)

### Practice:

* Build a churn prediction or classification model using PySpark ML

---

## üöÄ Stage 6: Optimization and Tuning

**Goal:** Optimize performance for large datasets.

### Topics:

* Caching and Persisting
* Partitioning and Repartitioning
* Broadcast variables
* Accumulators
* Lazy evaluation
* Performance tuning tips (shuffle, memory usage, etc.)

---

## üîå Stage 7: Spark Streaming & Structured Streaming (Optional but Valuable)

**Goal:** Work with real-time data pipelines.

### Topics:

* Structured Streaming vs DStreams
* Streaming from files, Kafka
* Streaming aggregations and windowing
* Writing output to sinks (console, memory, files)

### Practice:

* Build a real-time dashboard (e.g., word count from streaming text)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stage 8: Real-World Projects

**Goal:** Solidify skills through end-to-end projects.

### Sample Projects:

1. **Retail Sales Analysis** (CSV + SQL + joins + window functions)
2. **Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis** (Streaming + MLlib)
3. **Customer Churn Prediction** (End-to-end pipeline)
4. **Log Analytics Dashboard** (Streaming + Structured queries)

---
